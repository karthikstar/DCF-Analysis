# Investment Thesis

Apple is one of the world’s largest and most profitable companies, with consistent free cash flow generation.

Despite strong fundamentals, a conservative DCF approach suggests the stock may be priced above its intrinsic value.

Key driver: slowing free cash flow growth compared to its past performance.

# Discount Cash Flow Model for Intrinsic Value

A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is a valuation method used to estimate the intrinsic value of a stock or an investment based on its expected future cash flows. DCF attempts to figure out the value of an investment today, based on projections of how much money it will generate in the future. (Investopedia)

## Why Use Discount Cash Flow Model?

- **Free Cash Flow is King**: stocks and business valuation emphasize the critical importance of a company's ability to generate cash. DCF estimates future cash flow to value today's stock price.  
- **Time Value of Money**: Money in the future is worth less than money today. So, we need to *discount* future cash flows to find out what they're worth right now.

## Steps of the Discount Cash Flow Model

1. **Estimate Future Cash Flows**  
   *"First, we predict how much cash the company will generate in the future, usually for the next 5–10 years."*

2. **Determine a Discount Rate**  
   *"Then, we choose a 'discount rate.' This is like an interest rate that represents the risk of investing in the company and the time value of money."*

3. **Calculate Present Value**  
   *"We use this discount rate to calculate what those future cash flows are worth today. This is called the 'present value.' "*

4. **Terminal Value**  
   *"We also estimate a 'terminal value' — what the company might be worth after our specific forecast period."*

5. **Sum It Up**  
   *"We add up all these present values to get the estimated value of the company."*

6. **Per Share Value**  
   *"Finally, we divide this by the number of shares to get a per-share value."*

## Analysis
Our DCF analysis shows that the AAPL may be **overvalued**.

- Currently, AAPL is at $230.
- But based on our our discounted free cash flow model, AAPL stock should be at $97, assuming our future free cash flows we estimated are indeed true, and we performed present value and applied the appropriate wacc and terminal growth.


### Limitations
- Using average growth rate as the forecast for future free cash flows is not the most sophisticated
- Doesn't consider seasonaility, probability / likelihood of free cash flows increasing at a straight line. Might not be realistic.

### Potential Improvements
- Using other APIs e.g Alphavantage that offers more historical data. Yahoo query/ Yahoo finance only provides data for recent few years.
- Using a more sophisticated model instead of average growth rate to estinmate future free cash flows

## Conclusion

- DCF suggests Apple trades at a significant premium to intrinsic value.
- Market likely prices in continued innovation (AI, Vision Pro, services) and shareholder returns (buybacks, dividends) beyond conservative forecasts.
- Investors should weigh whether Apple’s growth optionality justifies the premium.
